# zkEmail Swift Package via MoproFFI

This package is used to generate a Swift SDK that wraps zkEmail bindings for use in iOS applications.

## How to Import the Package

### Option 1: Using Xcode

1. Open your project in Xcode.

2. Go to **File > Add package dependencies**.

3. In _Search or Enter Package URL_, enter the URL: `https://github.com/zkmopro/zkemail-swift-package`

4. Choose the version and add the package to your project.

### Option 2: Using `Package.swift`

Add the following to your `Package.swift` dependencies:

```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "YourSwiftProject",
    // ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/zkmopro/zkemail-swift-package") // Or change to your own URL
    ],
    // ...
    targets: [
        .target(name: "YourSwiftProject", dependencies: ["ZKEmailSwift"])
    ]
)
```

### Option 3: Using CocoaPods

Add the following to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '15.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'YourAppTarget' do
  pod 'ZKEmailSwift', :git => 'https://github.com/zkmopro/zkemail-swift-package.git', :tag => 'v0.1.0'
end
```

Then run:
```sh
pod install
```

Alternatively, if the pod is published to CocoaPods trunk, you can simply add:

```ruby
pod 'ZKEmailSwift', '~> 0.1.0'
```
and run `pod install`.

## How to Use the Package

### zkEmail Proofs

```swift
import ZKEmailSwift

// Parse your .eml files as inputs
let inputs: [String: [String]] = [
    "header_storage": [...], // Array of header storage bytes as strings
    "header_len": ["123"],   // Header length
    "pubkey_modulus": [...], // Modulus components
    "pubkey_redc": [...],    // REDC components
    "signature": [...],      // Signature components
    "date_index": ["42"],
    "subject_index": ["100"],
    "subject_length": ["20"],
    "from_header_index": ["150"],
    "from_header_length": ["30"],
    "from_address_index": ["200"],
    "from_address_length": ["40"]
]

// Generate the proof
let proofData = try! proveZkemail(srsPath: "/path/to/srs", inputs: inputs)

// Verify the proof
let isValid = try! verifyZkemail(srsPath: "/path/to/srs", proof: proofData)
```


> [!WARNING]  
> The package supports multiple circuit types including zkEmail's Noir circuits. If you'd like to update the circuits or switch to a different proving scheme, please refer to the [How to Build the Package](#how-to-build-the-package) section.<br/>
> Circuit source code: https://github.com/zkmopro/circuit-registry<br/>
> Example assets can be found in the test-e2e app or the circuit registry.

## How to Build the Package

This package relies on bindings generated by the Mopro CLI.
To learn how to build Mopro bindings, refer to the [Getting Started](https://zkmopro.org/docs/getting-started) section.
If you'd like to generate custom bindings for your own circuits or proving schemes, check out the guide on how to use the Mopro CLI: [Rust Setup for Android/iOS Bindings](https://zkmopro.org/docs/setup/rust-setup#setup-any-rust-project).

Then, replace the entire bindings directory with your generated files in the following location: [Sources/MoproiOSBindings](Sources/MoproiOSBindings)

Alternatively, you can run the following commands to copy your generated bindings into the correct location:

```sh
cp -r ../path/to/your/bindings/MoproiOSBindings ./Sources
```
