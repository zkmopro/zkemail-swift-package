# Mopro Swift Package

This package is used to generate a Swift SDK that wraps Mopro bindings for use in iOS applications.

## How to Import the Package

### Option 1: Using Xcode

1. Open your project in Xcode.

2. Go to **File > Add package dependencies**.

3. In _Search or Enter Package URL_, enter the URL: `https://github.com/zkmopro/mopro-swift-package`

4. Choose the version and add the package to your project.

### Option 2: Using `Package.swift`

Add the following to your `Package.swift` dependencies:

```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "YourSwiftProject",
    // ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/zkmopro/mopro-swift-package") // Or change to your own URL
    ],
    // ...
    targets: [
        .target(name: "YourSwiftProject", dependencies: ["MoproFFI"])
    ]
)
```

## How to Use the Package

Here is an example of how to integrate and use this package

```swift
import MoproFFI

// ...
let generateProofResult = try generateCircomProof(zkeyPath: zkeyPath, circuitInputs: input_str, proofLib: ProofLib.arkworks)
```

Or checkout the [test-e2e](https://github.com/zkmopro/mopro/blob/793626f32ed34dcde382f5f304c301563126bc9d/test-e2e/ios/mopro-test/ContentView.swift#L90) app.

> [!WARNING]  
> The default bindings are built specifically for the `multiplier2` circom circuit. If you'd like to update the circuit or switch to a different proving scheme, please refer to the [How to Build the Package](#how-to-build-the-package) section.<br/>
> Circuit source code: https://github.com/zkmopro/circuit-registry/tree/main/multiplier2<br/>
> Example .zkey file for the circuit: http://ci-keys.zkmopro.org/multiplier2_final.zkey<br/>

## How to Build the Package

This package relies on bindings generated by the Mopro CLI.
To learn how to build Mopro bindings, refer to the [Getting Started](https://zkmopro.org/docs/getting-started) section.
If you'd like to generate custom bindings for your own circuits or proving schemes, check out the guide on how to use the Mopro CLI: [Rust Setup for Android/iOS Bindings](https://zkmopro.org/docs/setup/rust-setup#setup-any-rust-project).

Then, replace the entire bindings directory with your generated files in the following location: [Sources/MoproiOSBindings](Sources/MoproiOSBindings)

Alternatively, you can run the following commands to copy your generated bindings into the correct location:

```sh
cp -r ../path/to/your/bindings/MoproiOSBindings ./Sources
```
